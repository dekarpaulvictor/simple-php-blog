# How To Play The Nyatiti

_Nyatiti_ is a stringed musical instrument originating from Kenya's *Luo*
community. It has 5 to 8 strings and is normally plucked to produce beautiful
sounds. Ayub Ogada, a famous *Nyatiti* player, visited our offices two days ago
to show us how this musical instrument is played.
